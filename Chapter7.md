# `1. Cybersecurity`

Today cybercrime cause huge problems for society. Personally, finically, and even in matters of national security. Just in the
last few years, hundreds of millions of credit card numbers have been stolen. Tens of millions of social security numbers had
health care records were compromised. Even nuclear centrifuges have been hacked and unmanned aerial drones have been hijacked.
This is all done by exploiting vulnerabilities in hardware and software. Or more often by taking advantage of unintentional
decisions made by the people using the software. 

Today, the largest countries not only have a regular army, but also have a well-armed cyber army. In fact, the next world war
may not be fought with traditional weapons but with computers, used to shut down national water supplies, energy grids, and
transportation systems. 

Whenever we go online—to shop, chat with our friends, or do anything else—we put ourselves at risk of cybercrime. Computer
viruses can corrupt our files, hackers can steal our data, and criminals can trick us into revealing sensitive information.
But luckily there are simple steps we can take to protect our digital lives.

Cybersecurity is the protection of internnet-connected systems, including hardware, software and data, from cyberattacks.
