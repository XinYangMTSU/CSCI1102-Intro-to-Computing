# `1. Packets`

Say you want to play a song from Spotify. Howâ€™s it possible for every piece of data to be delivered to you reliably? 
The way information gets transferred from one computer to another is pretty interesting. It need not follow a fixed path. In
fact, your path may change in the midst of a computer-to-computer conversation. Information on the Internet goes from one
computer to another in what we call a packet of information, and a packet travels from one place to another on the internet a
lot like how you might get from one place to another in a car, depending on traffic congestion or road conditions, you might
choose or be forced to take a different route to get to the same place each time you travel.
