# Chapter 4: Internet

The Internet is changing how people interact and connect. But how does it work? In this chapter, you’ll learn what is Internet
and how bits information are transmitted over the most common mediums (copper wire, fiber-optic cable, and radio waves) used
to connect devices on the Internet.

# `1. What is Internet?`

The `Internet` is the global system of interconnected `computer networks` that use the Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) to
link devices worldwide. It is a network of networks that consists of private, public, academic, business, and government
networks of local to global scope, linked by a broad array of electronic, wireless, and optical networking technologies.

It was a result of another experiment called ARPANET, which stood for Advanced Research Project Agency Network. It was a
Defense Department research project. The internet is made up of an incredibly large number of independently operated networks.
The system is fully `distributed`. There is no central control that is deciding how packets are routed or where pieces of the
network are built.

The Internet is like the postal service. Instead of boxes and envelopes, the Internet ships `binary information`. Information
is made of bits. Everything on the Internet is represented and sent around as bits.

# `2. Wires, Cables and Wifi.`

How does a picture, text message, or email get sent from one place to another? It’s the internet that was made to move
information. Throughout history, we’ve built many systems that can send binary information through different types of physical
mediums such as telegraph. Today, we physically send bits by electricity, light, and radio waves.

      Since the telephone’s advent over 100 years ago, the dominant way to “wire” the home involved 
      the use of copper wire. 
      The copper phone wire is perfectly adequate for a voice signal, which is what it was intended for. 
      Copper wire is used to transmit binary messages using electricity - a voltage on the wire means one state, 
      and no voltage means the other.
      
### ![#0099ff](https://placehold.it/15/0099ff/000000?text=+) `Light`

      Fiber optics refers to technology that transmits data through thin strands of a highly transparent material 
      that usually is either glass or plastic. 
      You send bits as light beams from one place to another using fiber optic cables. 
      A thread of glass engineered to reflect light. 
      Light bounces up and down the length of the cable until it is received on the other end. 
      By the mid-1980s, fiber’s bandwidth and distance capabilities made it significantly less expensive than other
      communication mediums, so it has replaced them.

### ![#cc0066](https://placehold.it/15/cc0066/000000?text=+) `Radio Waves`

      While fiber optics seem to have many advantages over copper, wireless broadband is gaining 
      in popularity and usage.
      When it receives data, it translates it into radio waves then translate it back into bits for the user.
