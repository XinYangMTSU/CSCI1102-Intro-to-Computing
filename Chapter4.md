# Chapter 4: Computer Networking

The Internet is changing how people interact and connect. But how does it work? In this chapter, you’ll learn how the
computers all across the world communicate with each other:

# `1. What is Internet?`

The `Internet` is the global system of interconnected `computer networks` that use the Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) to
link devices worldwide. It is a network of networks that consists of private, public, academic, business, and government
networks of local to global scope, linked by a broad array of electronic, wireless, and optical networking technologies.

It was a result of another experiment called ARPANET, which stood for Advanced Research Project Agency Network. It was a
Defense Department research project. The internet is made up of an incredibly large number of independently operated networks.
The system is fully `distributed`. There is no central control that is deciding how packets are routed or where pieces of the
network are built.

The Internet is like the postal service. Instead of boxes and envelopes, the Internet ships `binary information`. Information
is made of bits. Everything on the Internet is represented and sent around as bits. But, it’s not like we’re physically
sending ones and zeros from one place to another.
