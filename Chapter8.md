# `1. Artificial Intelligence.`

In computer science, `artificial intelligence (AI)`, sometimes called machine intelligence, is intelligence demonstrated by
machines, in contrast to the natural intelligence displayed by humans and animals (wikipedia). AI is a broad branch of
computer science. The goal of AI is to create systems that function intelligently and independently. The easiest way to think
about artificial intelligence is in the context of a human. 

#### ![#ff00ff](https://placehold.it/15/00ff00/000000?text=+) Human can speak and listen to communicate through language this is the field of speech recognition. Much of speech recognition is statistically based. Hence it's called statistically learning.

Human can write and read text in a lanuage. This is the field of Natural Lanuage Processing (NLP). 

Human can see with their eyes and process what they see. This is the field of Computer Vision.

Human recognize the sence around them through their eyes which create images of that world  

Human can understand their environment and move around fluidly. This is the field of robotics.

Human have the ability to see patterns such as grouping of like objects. This is the field of pattern regocnition. Machines are even better at pattern recognition because they can use more data dimensions of data. This is the field of machine learning.

The human brain is a network of neurons and we use theset to learn things if we can replicate the structure and the function of the human brain we might be able to get cognitive capabilities in machines. This is the field of neurol networks. If these neural networks are more complex and deeeper, and we use those to learn complex things that is the field of deep learning.




# `2. Machine Learning.`

Every computer on the Internet has an address that uniquely identifies it. An `IP address` is a number identifying of a
computer or another device on the Internet. An address on the Internet is just a number: 141.72.251.38. The addressing system
for computers on the Internet is similar to a mailing address, and it forms part of one of the most important protocols used
in internet communication, simply called the `Internet Protocol`, or IP. A computer’s address, then, is called its `IP
address`. Visiting a website is really just your computer asking another computer for information. Your computer sends a
message to the other computer’s IP address, and it also sends along its origin address so the other computer knows where to
send its response.

As you've seen, an IP address is just a bunch of numbers. These numbers are organized in a hierarchy. Just like a home
address has a country, a city, a street, and a house number, an IP address has many parts.

Each of these numbers is represented in bits. Traditional IP addresses are `32 bits` long, with eight bits for each part of
the address. The earlier numbers usually identify the country and regional network of the device. Then come the subnetworks.
And then, finally, the address of the specific device. This version of IP addressing is called `IPv4`. It was designed in
1973, and widely adopted in the early 80s, and provides for more than `4 billion unique addresses` for devices connecting to
the internet.

But the internet has turned out to be much more popular than people imagined, and 4 billion unique addresses won’t be
enough. We are now in the middle of a multi-year transition to a longer IP address format called `IPv6`, which uses `128 bits`
per address, and provides over `340 undecillion unique addresses` (![equation](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%7B3.4%7D\times%7B10^{38})).

# `3. Deep Learning.`

Most users never see or care about internet addresses. A system called the `Domain Name System`, or DNS, associates names,
like `www.google.com`, with the corresponding addresses. Your computer uses the DNS to look up domain names and get the
associated IP address, which is used to connect your computer to the destination on the internet. 

A domain name is the text version of an IP address. Domain names are easy for people to remember and type. A `domain name
system` is maintained by a `distributed` database system. It is a collection of multiple, logically interrelated databases
distributed over a computer network.

</p>

How do we design a system for billions of devices to find any one of billions of different websites? The answer is that DNS
servers are connected in a distributed hierarchy, and are divided into zones, splitting up responsibility for the major
domains such as .org, .com, .net, and so on.
