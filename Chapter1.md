# Chapter 1: Introduction to computer architecture

Computers are everywhere! They’re on our desktops, in our homes, in people’s pockets, or people have them on their wrists. 
But while most of us use this revolutionary technology daily, we don’t often ask, what makes a computer a computer? 
And how does it even work?

In this chapter, you’ll learn how computers work:

1.Different parts of the computer that input, output, store and process all information.

2.How computers do everything from simple math to simulating entire virtual worlds.

## What makes a computer a computer?

It would need to take input, store information, process it, and then output the results. 
This might sound simple, but these four things are common to all computers. And that’s what makes a computer a computer.

The earliest computers were made out of wood and metal with mechanical levers and gears. By the 20th century though, 
computers started using electrical components. These early computers were really large and really slow. A computer 
the size of a room might take hours just to do a basic math problem.

ENIAC (Electronic Numerical Integrator and Computer) was amongst the earliest electronic general-purpose computers made. 
The ENIAC computing system was built by John Mauchly and J. Presper Eckert at the Moore School of Electrical Engineering of
the University of Pennsylvania

Computers started out as basic calculators, which were only manipulating numbers back then. But now we can use them to talk to
each other, play games, control robots, and do any fancy stuff that you could probably imagine.

Modern computers look nothing like those old machines, but they still do the same four things.

First, we’ll talk about input. You can tell a computer what to do with the keyboard. You can tell them what to do with the
mouse, the microphone, the camera. And now if you’re wearing a computer on your wrist, it might listen to your heartbeat. And
a touchscreen can actually sense your finger and it takes that as input on what it’s doing.
