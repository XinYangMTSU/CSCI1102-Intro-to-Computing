# Chapter 1: Introduction to computer architecture

Computers are everywhere! They’re on our desktops, in our homes, in people’s pockets, or people have them on their wrists. 
But while most of us use this revolutionary technology daily, we don’t often ask, what makes a computer a computer? 
And how does it even work?

In this chapter, you’ll learn how computers work:

1.Different parts of the computer that input, output, store and process all information.

2.How computers do everything from simple math to simulating entire virtual worlds.

## What makes a computer a computer?

It would need to take input, store information, process it, and then output the results. 
This might sound simple, but these four things are common to all computers. And that’s what makes a computer a computer.

The earliest computers were made out of wood and metal with mechanical levers and gears. By the 20th century though, 
computers started using electrical components. These early computers were really large and really slow. A computer 
the size of a room might take hours just to do a basic math problem.
