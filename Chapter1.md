# Chapter 1: Introduction to computer architecture

Computers are everywhere! They’re on our desktops, in our homes, in people’s pockets, or people have them on their wrists. 
But while most of us use this revolutionary technology daily, we don’t often ask, what makes a computer a computer? 
And how does it even work?

In this chapter, you’ll learn how computers work:

1.Different parts of the computer that input, output, store and process all information.

2.How computers do everything from simple math to simulating entire virtual worlds.

## What makes a computer a computer?

It would need to take input, store information, process it, and then output the results. 
This might sound simple, but these four things are common to all computers. And that’s what makes a computer a computer.

The earliest computers were made out of wood and metal with mechanical levers and gears. By the 20th century though, 
computers started using electrical components. These early computers were really large and really slow. A computer 
the size of a room might take hours just to do a basic math problem.

ENIAC (Electronic Numerical Integrator and Computer) was amongst the earliest electronic general-purpose computers made. 
The ENIAC computing system was built by John Mauchly and J. Presper Eckert at the Moore School of Electrical Engineering of
the University of Pennsylvania

Computers started out as basic calculators, which were only manipulating numbers back then. But now we can use them to talk to
each other, play games, control robots, and do any fancy stuff that you could probably imagine.

Modern computers look nothing like those old machines, but they still do the same four things.

First, we’ll talk about input. You can tell a computer what to do with the keyboard. You can tell them what to do with the
mouse, the microphone, the camera. And now if you’re wearing a computer on your wrist, it might listen to your heartbeat. And
a touchscreen can actually sense your finger and it takes that as input on what it’s doing.

1.Input Device:
---------------

* Keyboard
* Mouse
* Scanner
* Web Cam
* Touchscreen

All these different inputs give the computer information, which is then stored in memory. A computer’s processor takes
information for memory it manipulates it or changes it using the algorithm, which is just a series of commands, and then it
sends the process information back to be stored in memory again. This continues until the processed information is ready to be
output.

2.Storage/Memory:
-----------------

* Primary Memory
  * RAM (Main Memory)
  * ROM

* Secondary Memory
  * Hard Disk
  * Floppy Drive
  * CD

Computers use two types of storage: Primary storage and secondary storage. Memory is also known as primary storage, primary
memory, main storage, internal storage, main memory, and RAM (Random Access Memory); all these terms are used interchangeably
by people in computer circles. The CPU interacts closely with primary storage, or main memory, referring to it for both
instructions and data. 

A computer's memory holds data only temporarily, at the time the computer is executing a program. Secondary storage holds
permanent or semi-permanent data on some external magnetic or optical medium. 


3.Processor/CPU:
----------------

* CPU (Central Processing Unit)
 * Control Unit
 * Arithmetic/Logic Unit

The control unit of the CPU directs the entire computer system to carry out or execute, stored program instructions. Like an
orchestra leader, the control unit does not execute program instructions; rather, it directs other parts of the system to do
so. The control unit must communicate with both the arithmetic/logic unit and memory. 

The arithmetic/logic unit (ALU) executes all arithmetic and logical operations. ALU can perform four kinds of arithmetic
operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.


4.Output Device:
----------------

* Printer
* Monitor
* Speaker
* Earphone
* Projector

A computer display can show texts, photos, videos or interactive games, even virtual reality. The output of a computer may
even include signals to control a robot. And when computers connect over the internet, the output from one computer becomes
the input to another and vice versa.

All computers do the same 4 things. Each of these things is done by different part of the computer. There are input devices
that take input from the outside world and convert it into binary information. There’s the memory to store this information.
There’s a central processing unit, or CPU, where all the calculations are done. And finally, there are output devices that
take information and convert it into the physical output.

The CPU is a silicon chip that is the ‘brain’ of a computer system. It executes program instructions and data and controls all
the devices within the machine.
