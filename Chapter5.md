# Chapter 5: Addressing system and Routers in Internet

In this chapter, we'll explore more deeply how communication between multiple computers can work over the Internet. We will
learn “Internet Protocol” addressing system, commonly known as IP Addresses. The benefits and security concerns associated
with routing traffic across the Internet:

# `1. IP addresses and DNS.`

Every computer on the Internet has an address that uniquely identifies it. An address on the Internet is just a number:
141.72.251.38. The addressing system for computers on the Internet is similar to a mailing address, and it forms part of one
of the most important protocols used in internet communication, simply called the `Internet Protocol`, or IP. A computer’s
address, then, is called its `IP address`. Visiting a website is really just your computer asking another computer for
information. Your computer sends a message to the other computer’s IP address, and it also sends along its origin address so
the other computer knows where to send its response.
